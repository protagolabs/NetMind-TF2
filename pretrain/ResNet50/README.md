This repo is for pretraining ResNet50 on [Imagenet-1K](https://image-net.org/) （you may need to create an account to access the dataset, or check the local disk）

we meet the result in [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

The result on ImageNet-1k is:

|ImageNet-1k|top-1 | top-5|
|---        |---   |---   |


The pretrained weights and training results could be found in ./result
