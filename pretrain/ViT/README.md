This repo is developing for pretraining ResNet50

we meet the result in [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

The result on ImageNet-1k is:

|ImageNet-1k|top-1 | top-5|
|---        |---   |---   |
|           |75.80 |92.95 |

The pretrained model can be download from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IUXl5O4r7LvmDAZ0D_9M4WApE47T0C3c/view?usp=sharing)
